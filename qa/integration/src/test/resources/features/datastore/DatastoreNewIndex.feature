    And System property "datastore.index.prefix" with value "null"
    And System property "kapua.config.url" with value "null"
    And System property "broker.ip" with value "192.168.33.10"

  Scenario: Simple positive scenario for creating default - weekly index
  Create elasticsearch index with default setting for index creation which is weekly
  index creation. Index gets created when user publishes data. Index is based on
  capture date, which is set to specific value, this value determines index name.

    Given Server with host "127.0.0.1" on port "9200"
    When I delete all indices
    And I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    Given The device "test-device-1"
    When I prepare a random message with capture date "2018-01-01T10:21:32.123Z" and save it as "RandomDataMessage"
    And I store the message "RandomDataMessage" and remember its ID as "RandomDataMessageId"
    And I refresh all indices
    When REST GET call at "/_cat/indices/"
    Then REST response containing text "1-2018-01"
    And I delete all indices

  Scenario: Simple positive scenario for creating daily index
  Create elasticsearch index with setting for daily index creation. Index gets created when
  user publishes data. Index is based on capture date, which is set to specific value, this
  value determines index name.

    Given Server with host "127.0.0.1" on port "9200"
    And I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    Given Dataservice config enabled "true", dataTTL 30, rxByteLimit 0, dataIndexBy "DEVICE_TIMESTAMP"
    And System property "datastore.index.window" with value "day"
    When I delete all indices
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    Given The device "test-device-1"
    When I prepare a random message with capture date "2018-01-01T10:21:32.123Z" and save it as "RandomDataMessage"
    And I store the message "RandomDataMessage" and remember its ID as "RandomDataMessageId"
    And I refresh all indices
    When REST GET call at "/_cat/indices/"
    And REST response containing text "1-2018-01-02"
    And I delete all indices

  Scenario: Simple positive scenario for creating hourly index
  Create elasticsearch index with setting for hour index creation. Index gets created when
  user publishes data. Index is based on capture date, which is set to specific value, this
  value determines index name.

    Given Server with host "127.0.0.1" on port "9200"
    And I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    Given Dataservice config enabled "true", dataTTL 30, rxByteLimit 0, dataIndexBy "DEVICE_TIMESTAMP"
    And System property "datastore.index.window" with value "hour"
    When I delete all indices
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    Given The device "test-device-1"
    When I prepare a random message with capture date "2018-01-01T10:21:32.123Z" and save it as "RandomDataMessage"
    And I store the message "RandomDataMessage" and remember its ID as "RandomDataMessageId"
    And I refresh all indices
    When REST GET call at "/_cat/indices/"
    And REST response containing text "1-2018-01-02-10"
    And I delete all indices

  Scenario: Creating two indexes with weekly index
  Creation of two indexes by publishing data with different capture date. As creation date if responsible
  for index name, this should result in two different indexes.

    And I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    Given Dataservice config enabled "true", dataTTL 30, rxByteLimit 0, dataIndexBy "DEVICE_TIMESTAMP"
