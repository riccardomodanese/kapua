Feature: Device data scenarios

  Scenario: Set environment variables

    Given System property "commons.settings.hotswap" with value "true"
    And System property "broker.ip" with value "localhost"
    And System property "kapua.config.url" with value "null"

  Scenario: Start datastore for all scenarios

    Given Start Datastore

  Scenario: Start event broker for all scenarios

    Given Start Event Broker

  Scenario: Start broker for all scenarios

    Given Start Broker

  Scenario: Start External Consumers for all scenarios

    Given Start External Consumers

Scenario: Connect to the system and publish some data

  Given The account name is kapua-sys and the client ID is sim-1
    And The broker URI is tcp://kapua-broker:kapua-password@localhost:1883
    And My credentials are username "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I have a mock data application named "my-app-1"
  
  When I start the simulator
  
  Then Device sim-1 for account kapua-sys is registered after 5 seconds
   And I expect the device to report the applications
    | DEPLOY-V2 |
    | CMD-V1 |
    | my-app-1 |
  
  Given I publish for the application "my-app-1"
  And I delete the messages for this device
  
  When I publish on the topic "my-topic-1/data" timestamped now
    | key | type | value |
    | foo.string | STRING | bar |
  And  I publish on the topic "my-topic-2/data" timestamped now
    | key | type | value |
    | foo.int32 | INT32 | 123 |
  And  I publish on the topic "my-topic-3/data" timestamped now
    | key | type | value |
    | foo.int64 | INT64 | 456 |
  And  I publish on the topic "my-topic-4/data" timestamped now
    | key | type | value |
    | foo.double | DOUBLE | 42.42 |
  And  I publish on the topic "my-topic-5/data" timestamped now
    | key | type | value |
    | foo.boolean| BOOLEAN | true |

  And  I wait 5 seconds
  And  I refresh all indices
  
  Then I expect the number of messages for this device to be 5
  And  I expect the latest captured message on channel "my-app-1/my-topic-5/data" to have the metrics
    | key | type | value |
    | foo.boolean | BOOLEAN | true |
  
  When I stop the simulator
  Then Device sim-1 for account kapua-sys is not registered after 5 seconds
  And I delete the messages for this device
