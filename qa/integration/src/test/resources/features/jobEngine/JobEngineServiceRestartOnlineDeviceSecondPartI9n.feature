    And Init Security Context
    And Start full docker environment

    # *************************************************
    # * Restarting a job with one Target and one Step *
    # *************************************************

  Scenario: Restarting a job with valid Configuration Put step two times
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new valid Configuration Put step to the created job. Restart the job two times.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_OK

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    When Device is connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService has property clock.ntp.retry.interval with value 5
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys"
    Then I find 2 device events
    And The type of the last event is "CONFIGURATION"
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And I create a new job target item
    And Search for step definition with the name "Configuration Put"
    And A regular step creator with the name "TestStep" and the following properties

    When I create a new step entities from the existing creator
    And I search the database for created job steps and I find 2
    Then I restart a job
    And I confirm job target has step index 1 and status "PROCESS_OK"
    Given I query for the job with the name "TestJob" and I find it
    And I wait 1 second
    When I query for the execution items for the current job and I count 1
    And I confirm the executed job is finished
    Then I restart a job
    And I confirm job target has step index 1 and status "PROCESS_OK"
    Given I query for the job with the name "TestJob" and I find it
    And I wait 1 second
    When I query for the execution items for the current job and I count 2
    And I confirm the executed job is finished
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys"
    Then I find 3 or more device events
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService has property clock.ntp.retry.interval with value 10
    When KuraMock is disconnected
    And I logout

  Scenario: Restarting job with invalid Configuration Put And Command Execution steps two times
  Create a new job. Set a connected Kura Mock device as a job target.
  Add a new invalid Configuration Put and Command Execution steps to the created job. Restart the job two times.
  After the executed job is finished, the step index of executed targets should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_FAILED

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    And Device is connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService has property clock.ntp.retry.interval with value 5
    And Command pwd is executed
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys"
    Then I find 3 device events
    And The type of the last event is "COMMAND"
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And I create a new job target item
    And I search for step definitions with the name

      | Command Execution |
    And I create a regular step creator with the name "TestStep1" and properties

    When I create a new step entities from the existing creator
    And I search the database for created job steps and I find 2
    Then I restart a job
    And I confirm job target has step index 1 and status "PROCESS_OK"
    Given I query for the job with the name "TestJob" and I find it
    And I wait 1 second
    When I query for the execution items for the current job and I count 1
    And I confirm the executed job is finished
    Then I restart a job
    And I confirm job target has step index 1 and status "PROCESS_OK"
    Given I query for the job with the name "TestJob" and I find it
    And I wait 1 second
    When I query for the execution items for the current job and I count 2
    And I confirm the executed job is finished
    When I search events from devices in account "kapua-sys" and 3 or more events is found
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService has property clock.ntp.retry.interval with value 10
    When KuraMock is disconnected
    And I logout

  Scenario: Restarting job with invalid Configuration Put and Command Execution steps and multiple devices two times
  Create a new job. Set connected Kura Mock devices as a job target.
  Add a new invalid Configuration Put and Command Execution steps to the created job. Restart the job two times.
  After the executed job is finished, the step index of executed targets should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_FAILED

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    Then I add 2 devices to Kura Mock
    And Devices are connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock devices after 5 seconds
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService has property clock.ntp.retry.interval with value 5
    And Command pwd is executed
    When I search events from devices in account "kapua-sys" and 3 events is found
    And The type of the last event is "COMMAND"
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And I add targets to job
    And I search for step definitions with the name

      | Command Execution |
    And I create a regular step creator with the name "TestStep1" and properties
