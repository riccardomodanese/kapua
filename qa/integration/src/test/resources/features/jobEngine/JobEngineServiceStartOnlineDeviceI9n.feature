  Scenario: Starting a job with valid Command Execution step
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new Command Execution step to the created job. Start the job.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_OK.

    And I logout

  Scenario: Starting job with invalid Configuration Put and Command Execution steps and multiple devices
  Create a new job. Set connected Kura Mock devices as a job targets.
  Add a new invalid Configuration Put and Command Execution steps to the created job. Start the job.
  After the executed job is finished, the step index of executed targets should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_FAILED

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I add 2 devices to Kura Mock
    And Devices are connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock devices after 5 seconds
    Then Configuration is requested
