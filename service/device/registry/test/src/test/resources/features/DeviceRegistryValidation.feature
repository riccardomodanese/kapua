Feature: Device Registry Validation Tests
    The Device Registry Validation helper is responsible for validating parameters
    and permissions before any operation is performed on the database.

@setup

    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a regular device
    Create a regular device object. the update validator should OK it.

    Given A regular device
    When I update some device parameters
    Then No exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a null device
    Create a null device object. The validator should throw an
    exception.

    Given A null device
    And I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I update some device parameters
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a regular device search
    Validate the parameters for a device search. Both ScopeID and DeviceID
    are not null. The validator should be OK with it.

    Given Scope with ID 15
    And The device ID 4321
    When I search for a device with the remembered ID
    Then No exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a device search with a null device ID
    Validate the parameters for a device search. ScopeID is valid, but the DeviceID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given Scope with ID 15
    And The device ID null
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I search for a device with the remembered ID
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a device search with a null scope ID
    Validate the parameters for a device search. DeviceID is valid, but ScopeID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A null scope
    And The device ID 4321
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I search for a device with the remembered ID
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a regular device deletion
    Validate the parameters for deleting a device. Both ScopeID and DeviceID
    are not null. The validator should be OK with it.

    Given Scope with ID 15
    And The device ID 4321
    When I delete the device with the remembered ID
    Then No exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate deleting a device with a null device ID
    Validate the parameters for deleting a device. ScopeID is valid, but the DeviceID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given Scope with ID 15
    And The device ID null
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I delete the device with the remembered ID
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate deleting a device with a null scope ID
    Validate the parameters for deleting a device. DeviceID is valid, but ScopeID
    is null. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A null scope
    And The device ID 4321
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
    When I delete the device with the remembered ID
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a regular device client search
    Validate the parameters for a client id based search. Both the Scope ID and the
    Client ID are valid. The validator should OK it.

    Given Scope with ID 42
    When I search for a device with the client ID "test_client"
    Then No exception was thrown

Scenario: Validate a device client search with null scope
    Validate the parameters for a client id based search. The Scope ID is null and the
    Client ID is valid. The validator should throw an exception.

    Given A null scope
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "An illegal null value was provided"
