    Then The device matches the creator parameters

Scenario: Case sensitivness of named device searches
    Searching by client ID is case sensitive.

    Given The KAPUA-SYS scope
    And I configure the device registry service
        | type    | name                   | value |
        | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
        | integer | maxNumberChildEntities |  10   |
    Given A device named "CaseSensitiveTestName"
    Then Named device registry searches are case sensitive

Scenario: Find device by registry ID
    It must be possible to find a device in the registry by its registry ID.

    Given The KAPUA-SYS scope
    And I configure the device registry service
        | type    | name                   | value |

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    Then It is possible to find the device based on its client ID

Scenario: Try to find a device with an invalid registry ID
    Searching for a nonexistent device should not raise any exception. Only a null
    device should be returned.

    Given The KAPUA-SYS scope
    And I configure the device registry service
        | type    | name                   | value |

    Then I find 100 devices
    When I query for devices with BIOS version "1.3.0"
    Then I find 100 devices
    When I query for devices with BIOS different from "1.2.0"
    Then I find 201 devices
    When I query for devices with Client Id "TestDevice"
    Then I find 1 device

Scenario: Count devices in a specific scope
    It must be possible to count all the devices in a specific scope.
    To this end several devices are created in 3 different scopes. When
    counted, only the number of devices in the specified scope must be returned.

    Given The KAPUA-SYS scope
    When I configure the device registry service
        | type    | name                       | value | scopeId |

    Given I create 45 randomly named devices in scope 7
    When I count the devices in scope 6
    Then I count 30
    When I count the devices in scope 5
    Then I count 20

Scenario: Count devices with a specific BIOS version
    It must be possible to count devices based on arbitrary rules.
    To this end several devices are created with different BIOS version.
    A device count based on the BIOS version value is performed. Only
    the number of devices that match the specified BIOS version is
    returned.

    Given The KAPUA-SYS scope
    And I configure the device registry service
        | type    | name                   | value |

    Given A device named "TestDevice"
    When I update some device parameters
    Then The device was correctly updated

Scenario: Try to update the device client ID
    The Client ID of a defice cannot be changed after creation. Any attempt to
    alter this ID must be silently ignored. No exception must be raised.

    And I expect the exception "KapuaEntityNotFoundException" with the text "The entity of type device with id/name"
    When I update a device with an invalid ID
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Delete an existing device from the registry
    It must be possible to delete a device from the registry. To this
    end a test device is created and subsequently deleted.
    A search for this device should yield a null but no exception.

    When I delete a device with random IDs
    Then An exception was thrown

Scenario: Device factory sanity checks
    The Account factory must instantiate and return valid items. For this test it is enough
    that the items returned are not null.

    Then All device factory functions must return non null values

@teardown
Scenario: Reset Security Context for all scenarios
    Given Reset Security Context
